# OpenSCAD Projects

## Project Structure

- `src/` — OpenSCAD `.scad` source files
- `dist/` — Compiled `.stl` files (generated by `make build`)
- `tmp/` — Temporary files including PNG previews for verification

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build all .scad files to .stl
make build

# Build a single file to .stl
make build_one file=src/shelf.scad

# Generate a PNG preview for visual verification (uses tmp/ directory)
make preview file=src/shelf.scad
```

## Verifying OpenSCAD Output

After writing or modifying a `.scad` file, always generate a PNG preview and visually inspect it before considering the work done:

```bash
make preview file=src/your_file.scad
```

This renders `tmp/preview.png` which Claude can read directly to visually verify the shape. Use this to catch issues before building the full STL.

## OpenSCAD Conventions

- All configurable parameters should be declared at the top of the file with sensible defaults
- Use millimeters as the unit of measurement
- Use `$fn` for controlling curve smoothness (higher = smoother, slower)
- Prefer `minkowski()` or `offset()` for rounding edges over manual math when appropriate
