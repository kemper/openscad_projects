## Openscad projects

```bash
brew install openscad
make build
# or make one
make build_one file=src/stacked_polygons_offset.scad
```

You will have to fiddle with apple settings until it allows you to run openscad as an app.
Be sure to preview rendering it in openscad, or use a web version of openscad such <https://makerworld.com/en/makerlab/parametricModelMaker>
